#LeaderboardC2

__LeaderboardC2__ is a self hosted Open Source PHP Leaderboard for [Construct2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2). Post, fetch and display high scores.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.4+  with at least one library extension that deals with SQLite is required (either PDO, SQLite3, or SQLiteDatabase). PHP version 5.3.0 and greater usually comes with the SQLite3 extension installed and enabled by default so no custom action is necessary. 

To determine your PHP version, create a new file with this PHP code: `<?php echo PHP_VERSION; // version.php`. This will print your version number to the screen.

## Install

### Backend installation

1. Insure that you have the required components.
2. Download LeaderboardC2 or cloning this Github repo.
3. Upload LeaderboardC2 through FTP/SFTP or whatever upload method you prefer to the public-facing directory of your site.
4. Ensure that the permissions for the `data` folder and `yourbase.sqlite` file are set to `0777`.

#### Apache

If you're using Apache, make sure you activate the URL rewriting module (mod_rewrite) in your *apache.conf* (or *httpd.conf*) file. You should also create a *.htaccess* file containing the following:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
RewriteRule .* index.php [L,QSA]
```

The script tells Apache that whenever an HTTP request arrives and if no physical file (!-f) or path (!-d) or symbolic link (!-l) can be found, it should transfer control to index.php, which contains our main/front controller, and which in turn, invokes the framework.

The .htaccess file containing the Apache directives stated above should always be in the same folder as index.php.

You also need to set up Apache so it knows the physical location of index.php in your hard drive. A typical configuration is:

```apache
DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
<Directory "/var/www/html">
    Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks +Includes
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from All
</Directory>
```
